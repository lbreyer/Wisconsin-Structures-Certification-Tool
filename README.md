Project Description:
The Wisconsin Department of Transportationâ€™s (WisDOT) Bureau of Structures maintains the certification process for roadway structure work projects within the state of Wisconsin. All construction and upkeep projects must go through a verification process by which they are proposed, reviewed, then either accepted and put into action or rejected to be reviewed for removal or an updated proposal.

As a result of this, at any point the WisDot holds and processes hundreds of certifications in various steps of the verification process. These plans span years into the future and are spread all across Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Structures Certification Tool is the primary tool used by WisDot for accessing, displaying and mapping Bureau of Structures (BOS) certifications, projects and work concepts.

This application allows for a simple, centralized access point for BoS employees to directly reference necessary certification information for use in current and future construction scheduling and roadway structure maintenance.


My Role:

Similarly to my work with the Wisconsin Structures Asset Management System, I functioned as the back-end developer on the summer 2021 update and maintenance process for this project focusing mainly on refactoring the overall structural architecture of the application's code into a version of MVC framework designed for Windows Forms Apps.

The goal of reorganizing the code structure in this update was to divide the concerns of the project into the MVC components. By doing this, we allow for simplification of simultaneous development through separation of components with the hope of improving scalability as we further expand the application's functionality going forward.

In addition to my direct work on the application, I also researched and developed a standard model and guide to the style of MVC framework we would be using going forward as a coding team. Documentation I developed for this modified version of the MVC framework can be found below.
